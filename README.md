# YouTube User Comment Tracker

A Google Chrome extension that displays live-updating comments from a specific user AND/OR comments containing timestamps (like "0:19") on YouTube video pages in a transparent, draggable overlay.

## Features

- **YouTube API Integration**: Fast, reliable comment fetching via YouTube Data API v3
- **Automatic Video ID Detection**: Automatically extracts video ID from current YouTube page
- **Real-time Comment Monitoring**: Automatically detects new comments as they load on YouTube videos
- **User-specific Filtering**: Track comments from any YouTube username or channel
- **Automatic Timestamp Detection**: Finds comments with time references like "0:19", "1:23", "10:45"
- **Dual Mode Operation**: Track user comments, timestamp comments, or both simultaneously
- **Smart Positioning**: Overlay positioned relative to video player (bottom-right corner)
- **Enhanced Transparency**: More transparent background for better video viewing
- **Fallback System**: DOM scraping when API is unavailable
- **Improved Comment Loading**: Retry system with better delay handling and pagination
- **Draggable Interface**: Move the comment feed anywhere on the screen
- **Live Notifications**: Get notified when new matching comments appear
- **Auto-scroll**: Newest comments appear at the top of the feed
- **Comment Type Indicators**: Visual indicators for user comments vs timestamp comments
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes and YouTube layouts

## Installation

### Method 1: Load as Unpacked Extension (Development)

1. **Get YouTube API Key** (Optional but recommended):
   - Follow the instructions in `API_SETUP.md` to get a YouTube Data API key
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in `background.js` with your actual API key
   - This enables reliable comment fetching via the YouTube API

2. **Load Extension:**
   - Download or clone this repository to your local machine
   - Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
   - The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### Method 2: Install from Chrome Web Store (When Published)

*Coming soon - extension will be published to Chrome Web Store*

### API vs DOM Scraping

The extension works in two modes:

- **API Mode** (Recommended): Uses YouTube Data API for reliable, fast comment fetching
- **DOM Scraping Mode** (Fallback): Scrapes comments from the page when API is unavailable

Without an API key, the extension automatically falls back to DOM scraping, which still works but may be less reliable.

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
2. Enter the YouTube username you want to track (optional)
3. Click "Save Settings"
4. Leave username empty to track only timestamp comments

### Monitoring Comments

1. Navigate to any YouTube video (`youtube.com/watch?v=...`)
2. The transparent overlay will appear at the bottom-right of the video player
3. Comments will appear based on your settings:
   - **User + Timestamps**: Shows comments from your user AND any timestamp comments
   - **User Only**: Shows only comments from your specified user
   - **Timestamps Only**: Shows only comments containing time references (0:19, 1:23, etc.)
4. Drag the overlay header to reposition it anywhere on screen

### Comment Types

The extension identifies and displays different types of comments:
- **üë§‚è∞ User + Timestamp**: Comments from your target user that also contain timestamps
- **üë§ User Only**: Comments from your target user
- **‚è∞ Timestamp Only**: Comments from any user containing time references

### Timestamp Detection

The extension automatically detects comments containing time patterns like:
- "0:19 That scene was amazing!"
- "At 1:23 you can see..."
- "10:45 - best part of the video"
- Any comment with MM:SS format timestamps

### Managing Settings

- Click the extension icon anytime to change the target username
- Use the "Clear" button to stop tracking
- Settings are automatically synced across browser tabs
